# Additions

- Big books! These are basically the cross-over of fancy signs and book & quills.
  - They offer all the formatting options a fancy sign offers.
  - They have a larger space than regular books.
  - Like regular books, they can be signed, after which they are read-only.
  - Again like regular books, they can be copied in a crafting table using one written book and at least one non-written book.
  - Can be put into lecterns.
- Pride bookshelves! During pride month (or all year round if you toggle the config option), bookshelves will use pride-themed color patterns.
  - This was done due to a semi-recent incident in the greater modding community. If you're gonna complain, complain to them, they spited me into doing this.
