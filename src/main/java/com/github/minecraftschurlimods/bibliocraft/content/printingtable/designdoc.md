# Printing Table

In old Bibliocraft, the Printing Press and the Typesetting Table are two blocks: the Printing Press (and the Printing Press Chases) were for copying text pages, while the typesetting table was for printing and copying various books (including enchanted books).

The new design merges both of these blocks into the Printing Table. The Printing Table can:

- Copy Typewriter Pages
- Copy (Written) Book & Quills and (Written) Big Books, without losing the book generation as would be the case with normal book cloning
- Bind Typewriter Pages into a Written Book
- Merge Book & Quills and Big Books (separately)
- Copy Enchanted Books at the cost of XP
- Copy book-like items from other mods (e.g. Quark's Ancient Tomes once it updates)

As such, the Printing Table can switch between three modes: Copy, Bind and Merge. All recipes can be automated using hoppers, except for enchanted books.

The press also comes in an iron variant that accepts XP fluids from other mods. Using that fluid, enchanted book copying can be automated as well.
